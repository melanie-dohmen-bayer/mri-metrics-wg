<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p>
    The aim of this study is to quantify the quality of certain distorted medical images.
    In order to find reasonable parameters for distorsions, we ask the readers to categorize the 
    presented distorted images into the following quality levels:

</p>
<ul>
   <li> <div style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#008800;">"Perfect": No visible difference to the reference image</div></li><br>
   <li style="background-color:#00ff00;">"Good": Visible difference to the reference image, but good quality, no effect on diagnosis expected.</li><br>
   <li style="background-color:#ffff00;">"Borderline": Quality is not good, but image could still be used for "easy" diagnosis tasks.</li><br>
   <li style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ff0000;">"Bad": Very Poor quality, image should be rejected for any task.</li><br>

</ul>

<p>
For each case, you will find a different distorsion in each column, and increasing distorsion strengths in each row.
In the top row, you will find the weakest distorsion, in the bottom row the strongest distorsion.
</p>

<p>
    Please select 3 checkboxes in each column (for each distortion type), corresponding to the lowest image you would categorize
    in levels "Perfect", "Good" and "Borderline" respectively. All lower images will be assigned to level "Bad".
</p>
<p>
    If the first (most upper) image is already different from the reference image, please check at "No perfect image"
</p>

<p>
    When a sufficient number of boxes has been checked, all distorted images should be framed by their category color,
    and the button "Next Case" will appear below.
    By clicking on the button, a download will be triggered with your "annotations.csv" file.
    After each case, this can be overwritten, because it includes all previous cases of your session and uploaded annotations.
</p>

<p>
    If you start a new session, you should upload your annotation file first and then continue your annotations.
</p>

<p>
Please try the to train the annotation process and 
to get familiar with the variety of distortions:
